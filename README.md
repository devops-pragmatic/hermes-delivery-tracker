# Hermes Delivery Tracker – DevOps Starter Skeleton

This repository provides a **minimal DevOps starter skeleton** for the Hermes Delivery Tracker assignment. It includes a basic Flask app, a sample SQLAlchemy model, a placeholder Apache config, and empty Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for you to complete as part of your assignment.

## What You Get

- Minimal Flask app with a health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Example SQLAlchemy model (not delivery-tracker-specific)
- Sample Apache HTTPD config (reverse proxy, no TLS by default)
- Empty `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (add your own implementation)
- Minimal test for `/health` endpoint
- Example CI workflow (GitHub Actions)
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` for tracking team contributions

## How to Start

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Set up your Python environment** (e.g., `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`).
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Flask app locally:**
   ```sh
   python -m app.app
   ```
5. **Run tests:**
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```
6. **Complete the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml** to containerize the app and orchestrate the stack (Flask, MySQL, Apache).
7. **Implement the delivery tracker features** as described in your assignment brief.
8. **Set up Apache as a reverse proxy** (and add TLS if required).
9. **Use the provided CI workflow as a template for your own.**
